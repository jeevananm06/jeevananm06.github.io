##  Who is this guy?
Good… question… Quite frankly, that’s something I’ve been trying to figure out my whole life, but I think I’m getting closer. Here’s what I’ve come up with so far.
I’m a Jeeva currently living in Coimbatore — an incredibly beautiful region close to the Western Ghats.
I'm interest in exploring new technologies. I work on C/UNIX and I’m familiar with few other technologies Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript. Apart from this I love to travel and explore places. Since I have bachelor degree in mechanical engineering I can understand concepts behind the huge machineries. Interested to explore physics also I'm interested to explain the concepts.
